## Session 1: Analyst Role

**Timestamp**: 2025-12-25
**Role**: Analyst (Mary)
**Status**: Complete

### Input Artifacts

- Operator verbal input (problem description)
- `bmad/00-brief/brief.md` (placeholder, unpopulated)
- `bmad/templates/brief.template.md` (template reference)

### Actions Taken

1. Loaded analyst agent definition
2. Checked existing brief status (unpopulated placeholder)
3. Initiated new brief creation workflow
4. Gathered problem context through clarifying questions:
   - Purpose: Foundation for future product
   - Focus: Fluid physics, 3D particles, object animation
   - Experience level: No prior browser 3D experience
   - Future product: Car physics with vibrant particles/environments
   - Timeline: ~1 year
5. Synthesized problem statement
6. Mapped stakeholders
7. Defined success criteria (5 measurable criteria)
8. Documented scope boundaries
9. Validated against quality gate checklist

### Outputs Created

- `bmad/00-brief/brief.md` - Complete project brief
