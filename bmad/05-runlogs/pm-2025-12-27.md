# PM Session Runlog - 2025-12-27

## Session Summary

**Role**: Product Manager (John)
**Date**: 2025-12-27
**Duration**: Single session
**Outcome**: PRD created successfully

## Input Artifacts

- `bmad/00-brief/brief.md` - Updated brief focusing on wizard learning experience

## Output Artifacts

- `bmad/01-prd/PRD.md` (v2.0) - Complete PRD for wizard learning experience

## Actions Taken

1. **Brief Ingestion** - Read updated brief (2025-12-27) identifying the new problem: demos exist but don't teach
2. **Persona Development** - Created 2 personas:
   - Alex the Aspiring Developer (primary learner)
   - Sam the Secondary Learner (future educational resource user)
3. **Requirements Elicitation** - Derived 7 functional requirements from brief:
   - FR-001: Wizard Navigation System (Must)
   - FR-002: Code Snippet Display (Must)
   - FR-003: Explanatory Annotations (Must)
   - FR-004: Flexible Navigation (Should)
   - FR-005: Live Parameter Connection (Must)
   - FR-006: Concept Categorization (Should)
   - FR-007: Integrated Demo Rendering (Must)
4. **NFR Definition** - Identified 6 non-functional requirements (performance, compatibility, usability, maintainability, accessibility, responsiveness)
5. **Prioritization** - Applied MoSCoW framework
6. **Acceptance Criteria** - Wrote Given-When-Then criteria for all MUST requirements
7. **Traceability** - Mapped all requirements to brief success criteria (SC-1 through SC-5)
8. **Validation** - Verified all workflow checklist items complete

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Updated PRD to v2.0 | Brief evolved from "create demos" to "teach with demos" |
| 5 Must requirements, 2 Should | Core wizard experience prioritized; flexibility is enhancement |
| No implementation details | Strictly adhered to PM boundaries |

## Notes

- Previous PRD (v1) addressed demo creation; demos now exist
- New PRD addresses the educational layer on top of existing demos
- Open question Q4 (micro-concept count) deferred to Architect

## Boundary Compliance

- [x] Only wrote to `bmad/01-prd/PRD.md`
- [x] No technology choices specified
- [x] No architecture decisions made
- [x] No implementation details included

## Recommended Next Step

`/architect` - Technical architecture needed to:
1. Analyze existing demo code structure
2. Determine snippet extraction strategy
3. Answer Q4 (micro-concept count)
4. Design wizard component architecture
