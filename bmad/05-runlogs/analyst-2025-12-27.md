## Session: Analyst Role - Brief Iteration

**Timestamp**: 2025-12-27
**Role**: Analyst (Mary)
**Status**: Complete

### Input Artifacts

- Operator input: Request for wizard-like learning UI with code snippets
- `bmad/00-brief/brief.md` (existing brief from 2025-12-25)
- Existing demo codebase (`src/demos/`, `src/ui/`)

### Actions Taken

1. Loaded analyst agent definition
2. Reviewed existing brief (iteration session, not new)
3. Explored current demo implementation to understand context
4. Asked clarifying questions:
   - Progression style? → Both strict AND flexible jumping
   - Concept structure? → Micro → larger → advanced (building blocks)
   - Code snippets? → Actual running demo code with explanatory annotations
   - Copy/paste needed? → No
   - Success criteria? → Understanding techniques and framework usage
5. Synthesized refined problem statement
6. Updated brief with new learning experience requirements
7. Validated against quality gate checklist

### Outputs Created

- `bmad/00-brief/brief.md` - Updated project brief (iteration)

### Quality Gate Results

| Check | Result |
|-------|--------|
| Problem statement clear | ✅ |
| 2+ stakeholders identified | ✅ |
| 3+ success criteria | ✅ (5) |
| Scope boundaries explicit | ✅ |
| No solution language | ✅ |
| Stakeholder validation | ⏳ Pending |

### Key Changes from Previous Brief

| Aspect | Previous | Updated |
|--------|----------|---------|
| Problem Focus | No 3D animation knowledge | Demos exist but don't teach |
| Core Need | Working demos | Guided wizard learning experience |
| Code Visibility | Not addressed | Actual code with annotations |
| Progression | Not addressed | Micro → Medium → Advanced concepts |

### New Success Criteria Added

- SC-1: Learner can explain particle emitter concepts
- SC-2: Learner understands Three.js framework patterns
- SC-3: Concepts build progressively
- SC-4: Code is visible and explained
- SC-5: Live parameter adjustment tied to code

### Open Questions Resolved

- Q1: Strict linear OR flexible? → Both
- Q2: Actual code OR simplified? → Actual running demo code
- Q3: Copy/paste? → No, focus on understanding
