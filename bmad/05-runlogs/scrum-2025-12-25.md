## Recommended Implementation Order

1. **story-001**: Project Setup & Core Types (foundation for everything)
2. **story-002**: Demo Renderer & Scene Manager (enables 3D)
3. **story-003**: Animation Loop & FPS Monitor (enables animation)
4. **story-004**: Input Manager (enables interaction)
5. **story-005**: UI Shell & Demo Selector (enables navigation)
6. **story-006**: Object Pool Utility (enables performance)
7. **story-007**: Particle Demo (first major feature)
8. **story-008**: Object Demo (second major feature)
9. **story-009**: Fluid Demo (third major feature)
10. **story-010**: Control Panel (enables experimentation)
11. **story-011**: Combined Demo (integration showcase)
12. **story-012**: Reset Capability & Polish (final polish)

## INVEST Validation

All stories were evaluated against INVEST criteria:

- **I**ndependent: Stories can be developed in sequence with minimal overlap
- **N**egotiable: Details can be adjusted during implementation
- **V**aluable: Each story delivers demonstrable value
- **E**stimable: Size estimates provided (S/M/L)
- **S**mall: Largest stories (L) are still single-PR scope
- **T**estable: Clear acceptance criteria defined for each
