# Project Brief: [Project Name]

> This document frames the problem space. It defines WHAT needs to be solved and WHY, never HOW.

---

## Executive Summary

[2-3 sentence overview of the problem and its significance]

---

## Problem Statement

### What is the problem?

[Clear, concise description of the problem. Focus on the pain point, not the solution. 2-3 paragraphs maximum.]

### Who is affected?

[List the specific stakeholders impacted by this problem]

- **Primary**: [Most affected group]
- **Secondary**: [Also affected]
- **Tertiary**: [Indirectly affected]

### What is the impact?

[Quantify the impact where possible]

| Impact Type | Current State | Measurement |
|-------------|---------------|-------------|
| Time | [Hours/days lost] | [How measured] |
| Cost | [Revenue/expense impact] | [How measured] |
| User Experience | [Frustration level] | [How measured] |
| Business Risk | [Risk description] | [How measured] |

---

## Stakeholders

| Stakeholder | Role | Interest | Influence | Key Concerns |
|-------------|------|----------|-----------|--------------|
| [Name/Group] | [Their role] | [What they care about] | High/Medium/Low | [Main worry] |
| [Name/Group] | [Their role] | [What they care about] | High/Medium/Low | [Main worry] |

### Stakeholder Relationships

[Describe any conflicts or alignments between stakeholder interests]

---

## Current State

### How is this handled today?

[Describe existing workarounds, manual processes, or current solutions]

1. [Current approach 1]
2. [Current approach 2]
3. [Current approach 3]

### Why current approaches fall short

| Approach | Limitation | Impact |
|----------|------------|--------|
| [Approach 1] | [Why it fails] | [Effect] |
| [Approach 2] | [Why it fails] | [Effect] |

### What has been tried before?

| Attempt | When | Outcome | Why It Failed |
|---------|------|---------|---------------|
| [Previous attempt] | [Date] | [Result] | [Root cause] |

---

## Success Criteria

> These criteria define how we will know the problem is solved. Each must be measurable.

| ID | Criterion | Metric | Target | Current |
|----|-----------|--------|--------|---------|
| SC-1 | [What success looks like] | [How to measure] | [Target value] | [Current value] |
| SC-2 | [What success looks like] | [How to measure] | [Target value] | [Current value] |
| SC-3 | [What success looks like] | [How to measure] | [Target value] | [Current value] |

### Validation Approach

[How will we verify each success criterion is met?]

---

## Scope

### In Scope

> These items WILL be addressed by this effort

- [ ] [Item 1 - specific capability or problem area]
- [ ] [Item 2 - specific capability or problem area]
- [ ] [Item 3 - specific capability or problem area]

### Out of Scope

> These items will NOT be addressed (documented to prevent scope creep)

- [Item 1 - why excluded]
- [Item 2 - why excluded]
- [Item 3 - why excluded]

### Boundaries

[Clear lines defining the edges of this effort]
