# Risk Register

## Overview

This document tracks identified risks and their mitigations.

## Risk Matrix

| ID | Risk | Probability | Impact | Score | Mitigation | Status |
|----|------|-------------|--------|-------|------------|--------|
| R1 | _Example risk_ | Medium | High | 6 | _Mitigation strategy_ | Open |

## Probability Scale
- Low (1): Unlikely to occur
- Medium (2): May occur
- High (3): Likely to occur

## Impact Scale
- Low (1): Minimal impact
- Medium (2): Moderate impact
- High (3): Severe impact

## Risk Score
Score = Probability × Impact

| Score | Priority |
|-------|----------|
| 1-2   | Low      |
| 3-4   | Medium   |
| 6-9   | High     |

## Risk Status
- **Open**: Risk identified, mitigation planned
- **Mitigating**: Mitigation in progress
- **Accepted**: Risk accepted, no action
- **Closed**: Risk no longer applicable
